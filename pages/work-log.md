The initial schematics of the project includes:
* micro USB
* NodeMCU
* Force Sensitive Resistor 0.5''(SparkFUn)
* 3.3k ohm resistor

Objectives of the inital design are:
* Familiarize myself with the Arduino IDE for NodeMCU
* Create environment to develop the project
* "Hello World" for this project is equivalent to obtaining sensor data in the serial port

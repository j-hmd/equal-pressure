# equal-pressure
NodeMCU project using Arduino IDE to take sensor inputs and send them to Blynk 

## Working History ##
This section's purpose is to document progress on the project.

### Design ###
The initial schematics of the project includes:
* micro USB
* NodeMCU
* Force Sensitive Resistor 0.5''(SparkFUn)

Objectives of the inital design are:
* Familiarize myself with the Arduino IDE for NodeMCU
* Create environment to develop the project
* "Hello World" for this project is equivalent to obtaining sensor data in the serial port
